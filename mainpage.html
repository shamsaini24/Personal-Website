        <span> That's me, Sham! I'm a Computer System's Technology student at BCIT, currently in my 2nd year. I'm also 1 of 50 people in my September 2017 intake to be selected for the co-op program.
           I'm one of, if not, the youngest students in the co-op program, possibly the entire intake. The experience of me being the youngest in any given room has matured me as a person, socially and
           professionally. I've lived in Vancouver all my life which has put me in the fortunate position of being near some of the biggest companies and determined startups. I’m a motivated guy and I’m
            aspiring to find my place in the expansive tech industry we have here.

                        The <a href="https://www.wafflehouserestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Waffle House Restaurant website</a> was a personal project of mine commissioned by one of my friends for his parents' restaurant. What went into the website was the culmination of my high school web dev
                        knowledge and what I had learned during my first term web dev course at BCIT. The website was built using one of my previous projects as a framework for a mobile friendly website, the
                        <a href="https://github.com/shamsaini24/Marina-Cafe" target="_blank">Marina Cafe</a>. As for languages, pure CSS and Bootstrap were used alongside HTML to build the website, with a bit of Javascript sprinkled
                        in. The website was sucessfully launched on Dec 8, 2018, and was hosted on his personal FTP server. He and his family enjoyed the website, and I ocassionally update the website to improve it.
                        I learned quite a bit during this project. I learned how to discuss details with clients that may not be as informed or concerned about the technical aspects. I also gained some knowledge on web
                         hosting and domain management technologies.

                        During the short break between my first and second terms at BCIT, all 50 co-op students were invited to the first 
                        annual BCIT Hackathon. We were organized into randomly selected teams of 4 or 5 people and were 
                        instructed to create "something a BCIT student would find helpful" within 48 hours. None of us knew how to make a coffee machine, so we created the Productivity Analyzer.
                        The Productivity Analyzer is a web app that asks the user to rank their productivity on a scale from 1 to 10 after a set amount of time, tracking your scores, 
                        and visualizing your scores over a certain time period. The app was built using HTML and Javascript for the front-end, SQL for back-end storage, and PHP connecting the two. Unfortunately, 
                        due to time constraints and lack of hackathon experience from a majority of our group, we were unable to completely flesh out the features that we intended to implement.
                        However, we learned a lot about working in an Agile/Scrum workflow, as well as gaining experience working with people we have never worked with before. What I learned over those 
                        two days has helped me both in school and in the workplace.

                        During my 2nd term at BCIT, we were tasked to make a functioning Chess Game using the 4 principles of object oriented programming (OOP). This was done over the span 
                        of 3 months, individually, using Java in an attempt to make us understand the importance of designing before coding. We were to build the game in stages: (1) design the game, (2) build
                        the board, (3) place the pieces on the board, (4) make the pieces move, (5) make the pieces interact with each other, and (6) add the rules. Designing the UML diagram seemed easy at 
                        first, until I had to apply what I had designed. After some design revisions, the board was made. Each step after the first had its fair share of technical difficulty, but a majority of my pain came from my 
                        design. Once the rules had been added, and the pieces moved how they should, our teacher had another task for us; converting the game into 3D chess. My design restricted me from altering the board without having the game break, this is 
                        when I learned the importance of design. At the end, I got my game to work but had I been more thorough in my design I could have saved myself from a couple long nights.
