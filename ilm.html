                                <p>I began my first co-op term at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) exactly one month after I had completed my first year at BCIT. 
                                    If you don't know what ILM is, they are a major player in the visual effects industry, with an extensive list of innovations, 
                                    inventions, and a list of movies that would make any film buff gasp in awe. In short: they're the biggest company people have 
                                    never heard of, but almost everyone has seen what they've done.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The job was mainly focused on supporting the artists that 
                                    worked there with technical issues and requests, comparable to on site IT support. Additionally, I was assigned the responsibility to 
                                    build and deploy workstations for new artists, on a weekly basis. Much of this work was assigned and tracked using a ticketing 
                                    system, which was my first exposure to such a system. Learning how to effectively keep track of tickets and write them
                                    helped me immensely later on when it became a major part of my next co-op. The job did not involve much in the way of programming 
                                    experience, but it did make up for it in other areas. The majority of the work was hardware related, which taught me great deal 
                                    about the various components of commercial level hardware and their use. My interactions with the artists that I was assisting 
                                    helped me improve my verbal communication skills, as I often needed to explain the problem to them in a simple way to them to 
                                    convince why a certain actions were required to solve the issue. At the end of my three month contract I left the company, but 
                                    I will never forget that experience.
